Documenting your solution pattern although pretty simple, is highly beneficial for those who seek to learn about it and see the details of how it addresses its proposed technical challenges.

== Get Started
You can choose between:

* Watching a 1-minute video starting a project from scratch, building and starting it;
* Get started in less than fifteen minutes with a brief xref:contributors-quickstart.adoc#_quickstart_guide[ quickstart guide] or
* Go deep into the details using the xref:contributor-in-depth.adoc#full-guide[full guide].

These are the core targets for those creating a new documentation: create, build and run, document , publish.
