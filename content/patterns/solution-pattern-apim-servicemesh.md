Use API management and service mesh together to setup a comprehensive service management architecture

<!--more-->

API-centric and microservices-based IT architectures improve speed, agility, and efficiency. Consistent and effective management of these interfaces and services is critical for successful deployment and use. Most organizations look for either an API management or a service mesh solution to accomplish this. Determining which approaches and tools to use within your organization can be confusing. However these two technologies are actually complementary and can be used together to deliver a complete service management architecture.

This solution pattern helps you understand how to use these solutions together to setup a comprehensive service management architecture.
