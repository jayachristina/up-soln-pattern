This solution pattern brings an architectural solution for scenarios where services integration must happen through data integration and cause no impact to the existing stack.

The architecture demonstrates how Change Data Capture (CDC) design pattern and event-driven architectures supports the extension of existing capabilities with no changes to legacy apps where new features can be delivered by cloud-native microservices and can deliver with zero impact new search capabilities through the integration of legacy and new services with specialized search index services.
